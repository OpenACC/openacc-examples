# OpenACC Examples Document
This repository contains codes featured in the OpenACC Examples Document. All code in this repository was created by either the OpenACC V&V team or members of the community. We will continue to add and edit code to the guide to conform to the latest version of the OpenACC specification.

For more details on the guide and other projects, please consult the [OpenACC V&V Website](https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/oaccvv/).

A goal for this project is to have direct community involvement in its creation. As such, we strive to properly communicate with and credit any community members who may submit code for the Examples Document. However, we understand some may not be comfortable submitting said information; therefore, your name, email, GitHub username, and date of code written are all optional.

For Features Referenced, please simply list what directives, clauses, and/or constructs are involved in the code. Please remember to provide what version of OpenACC, compilers, and compiler's versions you are using. This is important, as we try to test code on multiple compilers to ensure we get similar results. For the explanation, please explain in as few of sentences as possible what the code is doing. Please be direct and brief.

At this moment, we are only accepting code in C/C++ and Fortran.

Thank you for your contribution. We will look into your PR request and notify you via GitHub.
