# OpenACC Examples Document
This repository contains codes featured in the OpenACC Examples Document. All code in this repository was created by either the OpenACC V&V team or members of the community. We will continue to add and edit code to the guide to conform to the latest version of the OpenACC specification.

For more details on the guide and other projects, please consult the [OpenACC V&V Website](https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/oaccvv/).

## Submitting Code
If you wish to submit code to be used for the Examples Document, please push a folder containing any and all files you wish to submit to the correct folder in the Submissions folder and create a PR request for us to review. In your main file, please include the following information in the header, following the below format. Please name your main file about the topic of the code. Any other files that may help us or others either run the code or help explain the code should also go in the same folder. While we ask of you to summarize your code in the header, any and all comments in the code itself is more than welcomed. Please feel free to share any short reports, graphs, charts, etc. as well in your folder. While we cannot guarantee we will use them in the guide, it will be a valuable resource for us and members of the community to see. Your work will be credited if used.

A goal for this project is to have direct community involvement in its creation. As such, we strive to properly communicate with and credit any community members who may submit code for the Examples Document. However, we understand some may not be comfortable submitting said information; therefore, your name, email, GitHub username, and date of code written are all optional. If you believe you were either not properly credited or cited in the Examples Guide, or we published incorrected/unapproved information regarding you or your work, please contact us immediately. Refer to the Authors section for people you could contact.

For Features Referenced, please simply list what directives, clauses, and/or constructs are involved in the code. Please remember to provide what version of OpenACC, compilers, and compiler's versions you are using. This is important, as we try to test code on multiple compilers to ensure we get similar results. For the explanation, please explain in as few of sentences as possible what the code is doing. Please be direct and brief.

At this moment, we are only accepting code in C/C++ and Fortran.

Thank you for your contribution. We will look into your PR request and notify you via GitHub.
