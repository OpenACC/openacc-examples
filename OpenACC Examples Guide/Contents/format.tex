These are a collection of examples of directives, constructs, and routines for the OpenACC API. \newline

Each example code segment is named in relation to the section, and written in one of the three languages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{c} - C code
    \item \textit{cpp} - C++ code
    \item \textit{F90} - Fortran code
\end{itemize}

We currently only have code written in C, but we plan to add C++ and Fortran code in future revisions.
