Specific devices can be called with clauses or clause arguments using the \textbf{device\_type} clause. Clauses following a \textbf{device\_type} until either the end of the directive or until the next \textbf{device\_type} clause are device-specific clause for the device types specified for in the argument. If a directive has at least one device-specific clause, it is device-dependent, and otherwise it is device-independent.  

The argument to \textbf{device\_type} a comma-separated list of one or more device architecture name identifiers, or an asterisk; an asterisk indicates all device types not named in any other \textbf{device\_type} clause in that directive.
